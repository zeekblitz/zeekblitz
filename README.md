## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua but I go by zeekblitz on the internet. I graduated from UMass Boston in May of 2024 with a BS degree in computer science. I love everything about programming and believe I can do anything with code. During school I specialized in learning backend development with a hint of frontend thrown in there. I'd say my strongest PLs are Java and C. My dream is that someday I will have my own video game published and played by millions around the world.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my dream FPS game that I (currently) call "Resevoir" using the Godot Game Engine.
  - I'm also building a home security system using Raspberry Pis. ðŸ¥§
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Godot shaders.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on indie game dev projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my own indie game dev project.
